# Machine_Learning_Matlab
A compilation of built-in functionalities to apply multiple Machine Learning algorithms with Matlab. Requires the Machine Learning, Parallel Computing, Statistical and Optimisation toolboxes. 

The purpose of this work is to provide an insight into the methods and tools available within Matlab to perform Machine Learning. It is not intended to be applied to as part of a software package although I hope it can help develop algorithms in a more efficient way to those involve in hands-on Machine Learning research as that was the original purpose of this work. 

At the moment the data from Cortez et al. 2009 'Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties' is the only dataset used and hence a single subfolder has been created at the root of the repository.
